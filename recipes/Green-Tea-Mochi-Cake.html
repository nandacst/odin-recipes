    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chewy and studded with sweet red beans. This is an easy recipe that you can make in one bowl!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mochiko rice flour</li>
      <li>Softened butter</li>
      <li>Evaporated milk</li>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Baking powder</li>
      <li>Vanilla</li>
      <li>Matcha green tea powder</li>
      <li>Sweetened small red beans</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F</li>
      <li>Cream the butter with sugar. It helps to melt the butter a little first. Mix in the evaporated milk to the butter/sugar mixture. Mix eggs into the mixture. Mix in the rice flour, baking powder and vanilla. Mix in the matcha green tea powder. Mix in the red beans. I had a 16 oz jar of them, and used approximately half the jar because I didn't want the red beans overwhelming the green tea flavor.</li>
      <li>Pour mixture into a 9 x 13 pan. Bake for approximately 1 hour. Let cake completely cool, allowing the mochi to set, before cutting and serving.</li>
    </ol>
    </ul>
